Surefyre has a powerful yet easy to use search tool so you can always find what you're looking for. Results don't need to be an exact match. If it's in the ballpark you'll likely get the right result. The Search bar is always available in the Top Bar and supports the following text based search tools:
* Use quotations marks to search for a phrase (e.g. "Surefyre Systems")
* Use a dash - to exclude terms (e.g.-insurance)
* Narrow down using tags by including tag:<Tag to Search> keyword (e.g. tag:NewLead)
* Narrow down users associated with a file owner:<Username to Search> (e.g. owner:johndoe)
* When searching phone numbers omit () and -; only use numbers (e.g. (415) 555-1234 should be searched as 4155551234)
