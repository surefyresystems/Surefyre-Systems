Most fields are self-explanatory but a few things are worth noting:

**Staff status** - Should be granted to users who can have access to the administration site to be able to change the site configuration.

**Password** - Once the user has access to the system they will be able to change their password. The first one should only be a temporary password to get the user first logged in.

**Location** - You can setup multiple locations if your agency spans different office locations. If not, you can leave it blank.

**Groups** - You should assign at least one group to the user you are creating. If it is a staff user, it should be "staff", otherwise you can use "default". You also have the ability to create more groups for more advanced usage if needed.

# Editing a User

1. From any screen click the **Setup (gear) > Show Users**:

2. Click **Edit (pencil)** in the user record that you'd like to edit.

# Deleting / Deactivating a User

To ensure data and context is not lost, users cannot be deleted in Surefyre. When a user is no longer needed, they can be deactivated which will remove their ability to log in and appropriately remove them from user facing areas of the system such as the list of taggable users in Comments.

To deactivate a user you must have the proper permissions and follow the following steps:

1. From any screen click the **Setup (gear) > Show Users**:

2. Click **Edit (pencil)** in the user record that you'd like to edit.

3. Uncheck **Active**

Users can be re-activated from the Admin page or by your Surefyre administrator.
