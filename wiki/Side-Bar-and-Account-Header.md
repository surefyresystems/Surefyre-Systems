Upon selection of an Account, the **Side Bar** and **Account Header** will become visible. The Side Bar is used for navigation between all available Account Tabs. The Account Header has important information about the Account (such as Name) that remains visible regardless of which Account Tab you are working in.

# Account Header
In addition to important information, the Account Header provides access to Tasks, Comments, and More Actions all within the context of the selected Account.

## Tags
Tags are a versatile and powerful way to categorize your accounts. Simply start typing to see a list of all previously used tags that match. You can select from the list of existing tags or create a new one. Tags can also be defined when importing accounts or policies.

Examples of how to use tags:
> You are receiving leads from a new source and want to track their performance. Tag your new lead accounts with "newLeadSource" during the initial import. You can now run a quick report for all accounts with that tag and see how many have converted to customers.

> You've decided to identify key clients that need more frequent interaction. Add a "keyClient" tag to all applicable accounts. Now you can start your day by running a report of all your key clients to make sure you're keeping up with their status'.

## Tasks
Tasks associated to a particular Account are always available via the Tasks button in the Account Header. When clicked, a popup will appear which looks similar to the Upcoming Tasks panel on the Home Page. Here you can view, create, and delete tasks for the account. Tasks created here will also show up in the Tasks tab and your Surefyre calendar.  

See the [Tasks](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Tasks) section to learn more.

## Comments
Comments associated to the selected Account are always available via the Comments button in the Account Header. When clicked, a popup will appear where the user can read previous comments and post new ones. Comments are highly editable with support for different fonts, images, links, files, tables, and more.
