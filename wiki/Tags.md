## Tags
Tags are a great way to categorize accounts and policies. They are fast, simple and easy to use. To get started simply pull up any account or policy and look for the tag box.

Tag box for the account:

For policy:

### Adding a new tag
Simply type in a name for a tag and press enter to tag your item. **Tags cannot have space** since they are meant for small pieces of information. Simply use an underscore (_) instead. You can have as many tags as you want in your Surefyre system.

If we want to tag an account to callback you can simply start typing your tag:

And then press enter when you are done:

### Adding an existing tag

All previously used tags are remembered in Surefyre. To tag another account or policy simply start typing the same tag and quickly select the tag. For instance to tag another account with callback you can start typing "call":

Or you can always create a new tag if that is not what you are looking for - in this case we tagged the account with "called_in" instead:

### Searching tags

Finding all accounts that have a tag is easy by adding the "tag:" to the beginning of your search. Let's find all accounts with the tag "callback":
