## Comments
Comments can be added at anytime when on any account page with the comments dropdown:

You can mention any of your co-workers by typing the `@` sign and typing in the co-workers name. You can use the up and down arrows to find the correct user and press `enter` to select that user. Continue typing the rest of your comment and when you post it the co-worker(s) you mentioned will get an email notification:

To access all comments on a dedicated screen, tap the Comments tab on the sidebar.

### Emails as Comments
You can easily respond to comments using just email or post emails as new comments on an account.

**Responding to Comments via email**  
When someone tags you in a comment, you will receive an email notification. To quickly respond, simply send a reply email with your response. Your response message will be posted as a new comment on the account. This is a great way to communicate internally while on the go.

**Posting new Comments via email**   
If you would like to post emails that you received to an account you can do this through comments. When you go to the comments section of the account page you will see an email address like this:

You can copy this email address with the copy button ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30841716/35219069-d60c4c5e-ff25-11e7-8030-14e847169869.png) (highlighted in yellow above). 

Once you have the email addressed copied go to your email client (outlook, gmail, yahoo, etc.) and find the email you would like to post to this specific account. Then forward that email and paste in the address that you copied in the previous step and send it. Within a minute or two you should see it as a comment in the account (you may need to refresh the page).

Note: You must send the email from the account that is registered with Surefyre.
