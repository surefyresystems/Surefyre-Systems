### Sharing your Surefyre Calendar
Your Surefyre calendar can be shared with any of your favorite calendar apps. The first thing you need to do is enable calendar sharing in the your settings page. From the top bar on any page click the gear->settings. On the right hand side you will see the ability to share your calendar:

Once enabled keep this URL **private** and only share with people or applications that you want to share your calendar with. If at any time you want to invalidate your current URL and get a new one, or disable calendar sharing all together you can do so with the buttons on screen:

* [Outlook.com Calendar](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-Outlook-com-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c)
