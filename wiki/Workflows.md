Workflows are powerful tools that can save incredible amounts of time and effort as well as ensure you're team is always informed and operating efficiently. They automate tasks like sending user reminders / notifications, generating documents, and emailing accounts.

### Access Workflow Configuration Screen
Access the Workflow configuration screen by clicking **Setup (gear) > Admin > Workflows**. This will display a list of existing workflows. Select one to edit or click **+ Add Workflow** to create a new one.

### Workflow Transition Actions
Surefyre can automatically do things like send email notifications and assign tasks when a Workflow Transition takes place. Use the Workflow Transition Actions to ensure everyone is informed and all stakeholders have direction without any manual intervention.

**Send Email Templates**

[Email Templates](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Email-Templates) can be automatically sent to users, user groups, [account owners](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Account-Owners-and-Editors), [account editors](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Account-Owners-and-Editors), account followers, and/or the primary contact on the account. Note that these emails will display in the **Sent** tab within the [Email tab](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Email) on the account after they are sent.
