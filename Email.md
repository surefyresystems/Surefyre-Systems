### Dynamic Email Templates
With Surefyre you can create emails with placeholders that will pull information from the system when it’s time to send. This means one Email Template can be used for any account while still being personalized and including relevant data specific to that account and policy. For example:

> 
> Template:
> Policy documents for #lead.bus_name# are attached.
> 
> Sent email:
> Policy documents for Hammond & Miller Construction Inc. are attached.
> 

If this looks confusing, don’t worry, anyone can easily create and edit Email Templates. Check out the [Creating and Editing Email Templates](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Email-Templates) section to quickly learn.

### Email Status Tracking
Surefyre can track emails statuses such as when an email was actually delivered and when it was opened. To see this information, click on the Sent tab then select a sent email from the list. All logged activities such as Delivered, Opened, or Failed and the time at which they occurred are displayed above the message.

> 
> Note that tracking email opens is not currently available with Gmail integration.
> 

**Failed Emails**  
Emails can fail to send for many reasons. If an attempted email has failed to send, you can see the reason in the Sent tab. Click on a failed email in the list. The status of Failed with a reason in parentheses will be displayed above the message.

### Unsubscribe Links
For marketing campaigns, it’s important to allow recipients to unsubscribe if they don’t want continue receiving emails. Inserting Unsubscribe links is simple. In the Email Body text editor, click the Insert Link icon (chain), then the Choose Link icon (magnifying glass), then click Unsubscribe.

When an email recipient clicks an Unsubscribe link, Surefyre Email will not longer send them emails. Any future attempts to email them will fail, which will be indicated in the Sent tab.

### File and Document Attachments
Multiple attachments can be quickly added to emails. You can select from all DocGen generated documents as well as files that have been attached to the account. Simply  multi-select the documents or attachments from their respective sections on the email tab. All highlighted items will be attached to the email once it's sent.

### Recurring and Scheduled Emails
Emails can be automatically sent multiple times and/or sent at a later date. The fields to define Recurring Settings can be shown or hidden with the "Modify Recurring Settings" button.
