The Calendar is a powerful and integrated organization tool. Create, view, and edit calendar events and tasks for a single account or across your Surefyre instance. You can also overlay coworker calendars to ensure no conflicts are scheduled.

## Detailed Event List

Click the **Detailed Event List** carrot on right side of the calendar to see a list of events against the account. This is useful when trying to quickly determine the date of your last or next meeting with the account.
