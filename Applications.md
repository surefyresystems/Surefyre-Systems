Surefyre Applications is a simple but powerful tool that allows you to accept application submissions from agents or external users and convert them to new business. Applications can be guided through a workflow to ensure that the relevant teams or users can easily take necessary actions at each workflow state.

With Surefyre Applications you can:
* Create custom Application Templates for different lines of business
* Create new versions of existing applications 
* Allow submissions internally or from a publicly facing web form
* Define workflows with automation such as email alerts and task assignment at each workflow state
* Define access levels of each user / group at each workflow state
* Translate application data to new policies and record updates

## Using Applications

### The Applications Tab
Once permissions have been granted to Applications, you can access them in the **Applications tab** in the left side bar of an account.

The Applications tab will show a list of all applications against the account, their status, and some other key information. Click any application in the list to access the full application, tasks, comments, and activity history.
