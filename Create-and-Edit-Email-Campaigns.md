The Email Campaign setup screen is where you will define the emails in your campaign and the timing with which they are sent. For each email:

1. Select an [**Email Template**](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Email-Templates)

2. Set **Delay**. Once an account is added to a campaign, this is the number of days that Surefyre will wait before sending the email. For example:

> 
> "Intro Email" has a Delay of 0, it will be sent as soon as the account is added to the campaign.
> 
> "Follow Up Email" has a Delay of 7, it will be sent 7 days after the account is added to the campaign.
> 

3. Optionally specify **From** address, **Reply To** address, or add **Attachment groups**

4. Add additional emails by clicking **Add another campaign email**

5. Click **Save**
