Custom fields in Surefyre are an important feature that allows you to track any unique data they need against businesses, people, policies, or carriers. Custom fields play a key role throughout the application. For example, the DocGen pulls values from fields in order to populate forms. Defining what custom fields you will need and where they will be shown should be considered carefully in the context of your business processes.
