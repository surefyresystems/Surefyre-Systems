The Home Page is what you'll see when you first log in and is always accessible via the **Home** button in the [Navigation Bar](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Basic-Naviation). The default home page dashboard contains several useful widgets that all serve two main functions:
1. Provide important, high level information at a glance
1. Make it easy for users to quickly perform common or upcoming activities

You can also switch your default dashboard to a more calendar and task focused homepage by following these steps:

1. Click **Setup (gear) > Settings**

1. Set **Dashboard** to "Task Dashboard"
