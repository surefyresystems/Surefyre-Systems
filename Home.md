# Surefyre Guide

Welcome to the Surefyre Guide! This is your guide to understanding how to configure and use your Surefyre system. It's easy and anyone can do it, we promise.

Browse the navigation bar and select the feature you'd like to learn about or the action you'd like to perform. If this is your first time, looking at them in order is a great approach.

If you have issues, please use the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/issues) or reach out to your Surefyre representative.

> NOTE: The new Surefyre Guide is currently in-work due to a recent redesign. We are making new sections available as we complete them.

## Browser Support
Surefyre currently officially supports Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Please note that Surefyre is not currently optimized for Internet Explorer (IE).
