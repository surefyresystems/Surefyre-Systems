When the Ownership feature is enabled, you can control which users have access to which accounts by assigning Account Owners and Editors. When an account is assigned an owner, the account will only be visible to the **owner(s)**, m**anagers of the owner(s)**, and **editors**.

To assign owners and editors to an account:

1. Navigate to the desired Account

2. Click the **More Actions (3 vertical dots)** button in the upper right corner

3. Click **Add/Delete Owners**

_Note that when an owner is added, their managers will also be granted access with an **Added By** value of "Inherited". When an owner is removed, inherited access granted to their managers is also removed._
