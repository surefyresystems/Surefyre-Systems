Field Displays allow administrators to control which fields are displayed on which pages and where they are located. Both standard Surefyre fields and customer defined [custom fields](https://github.com/surefyresystems/Surefyre-Systems/wiki/Custom-Fields) can be added to a field display. Defining custom fields and field displays allow you to control what data is tracked in your Surefyre system and where users enter / view that data.
