# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

wikiToJekyll:

  # your user Github Name
  user_name: surefyresystems

  # your repository Name
  repository_name: Surefyre-Systems

  # for an organization / user, publication branch is master
  # for a project, publication branch is gh-pages

  # wiki repository url
  # if you live this blank, it will be derived from you code
  # user_name and repository_name
  #   eg : wiki_repository_url = user_name/repository_name/wiki'
  #
  # If you're importing a wiki from another code repository
  # you MUST set this url
  #
  # IMPORTANT: no git@github.com: in front
  #            You MUST use the htpps:// url or it will
  #            cause a submodule error on github
  #
  # Example : https://github.com/userName/repositoryName.wiki.git

  wiki_repository_url: # https://github.com/userName/repositoryName.wiki.git

  # wiki submodule folder
  # the underscore makes sure that this folder is ignored by Jekyll
  wiki_source: "_wiki"

  # wiki Jekyll generated pages destination folder
  wiki_dest: "wiki"

  # commit and push to Jekyll repository after wiki synchronisation
  commit_and_push: false
